  <section name="On Reporting Bugs">

<p>Apache Commons tracks bugs and enhancements in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/">JIRA</a>, under the Commons category. Each component has its own JIRA project. </p>

<p>The usual rules apply - please look to see if the bug already exists before reporting it; please only reports bugs and enhancements, if you have a question, please bring it to the mailing list. Including all your information will help the issue be dealt with quicker, however please use a little common sense and avoid those 50 page recursive stack traces. </p>

  </section>
  <section name="On Making Patches">

<p>If you have a code fix linked to your issue that you'd like to submit, please attach a patch file to the issue. </p>

<p>Patches should be created with the "-u" option, for instance: </p>

<pre>diff -u Main.java.orig Main.java > arg-fix.patch</pre> or
<pre>svn diff -x -u Main.java > arg-fix.patch</pre>

<p>
Note: You should give your patch files meaningful names. For instance if you 
fix a concurrency bug in the foo component do not call your patch file 
"patchfile.txt" but instead call it "foo-concurrency.patch". This makes it easier
for developers who need to apply a number of different patches.
