    <subsection name='Introduction'>
        <p>
        The <em>Apache Commons</em> project differs from many other Apache projects because 
        it is comprised of multiple, independently released components. The common release procedure
        for an individual component is documented here so that contributors can easily move from 
        component to component. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Individual components may vary from these practices, but these steps should prove sufficient for the majority
        of cases.
