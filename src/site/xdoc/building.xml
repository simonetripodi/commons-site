  <section name='Introduction'>
    <p>
    This document provides information on setting up and executing builds for
    Apache Commons components and web sites. The contents include best
    practices and conventions that commons components should follow.
    This information should be useful to committers setting up
    new components as well as to volunteers who want to build commons
    components or web sites from source or to contribute patches to the build
    artifacts.
    </p>
    <p>
    The assumption throughout is that we are working with a component named
    "Apache Commons Foo" that uses Maven as its build system, both for
    distribution binaries and for the web site.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some knowledge of Maven is assumed in this document.  Please refer to the
    <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/">Maven user guide</a>
    for more information. Most commons components now use version 2 of Maven,
    so this is the Maven version assumed throughout this document.
    See <a href="building-m1.html">here</a> for Maven 1 details.

  <section name='Local environment setup'>
    <p>
    To build Apache Commons components or web sites, you need to have Maven
    installed and the project source files checked out locally.
    </p>
    <subsection name='Getting and installing Maven'>
      <p>
      Follow the 
      <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">
      Maven download instructions</a> to download and install Maven.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Checking out the commons sources'>
      <p>
      Follow the 
      <a href="http://commons.apache.org/svninfo.html">
      commons subversion instructions</a> to check out the commons source
      files. If you want to build commons component web sites, you need to have
      the <code>commons-build</code> module checked out as a peer to whatever 
      component(s) you are trying to generate the site for. If you check out
      the full set of "trunks" using the svn externals "trunks-proper" or
      "trunks-sandbox" this will happen automatically.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Configuring local properties'>
      <p>
      You only need to configure local properties if you want to build using
      different versions of Java.
      See <a href="commons-parent-pom.html#Testing_with_different_Java_versions">here</a>
      for more details.

    <subsection name="Running the Tests">
      <p>
        To run a component's tests:
      </p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Source and binary distributions">
      <p>
