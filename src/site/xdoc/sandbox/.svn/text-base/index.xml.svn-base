        The Sandbox is a Subversion repository for Commons committers to
        function as an open workspace for sharing and collaboration.
        The Sandbox serves as a staging ground for project which are
        destined for what is known as the Commons Proper.

    <section name="The Apache Commons Sandbox - Google Summer of Code Projects">
      <p>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a><sup>TM</sup>
        is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various
        open source software projects. The Apache Software Foundation participates in
        the program every year.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the <a href="gsoc/index.html">Google Summer of Code space in Commons Sandbox</a>

    <section name="Status of the Sandbox Components">
      <p>
        Check the status of a sandbox component on 
        <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/commons/TheSandbox">the sandbox wiki page</a>
        or just ask on one of
        <a href="mail-lists.html">the commons mailing lists</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Sandbox component is considered active if there is a definite plan
        for promotion to the Commons Proper and there is an active group of
        existing committers working on a component.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Commons Sandbox component is considered dormant if there is little
        recent development activity and no individual or group of individual
        commiters has emerged to champion its ultimate promotion to
        Commons Proper. See the Commons
        <a href="dormant/">dormant components</a>
        webpage for a list of Commons components currently considered dormant.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Commons Sandbox component is considered inactive if there is 
        no active development for a sustained period of time.
