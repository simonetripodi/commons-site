    <section name="Welcome to the Apache Commons">
      <p>
        The Commons is an Apache project focused on all aspects of
        reusable Java components.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apache Commons project is composed of three parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="components.html">The Commons Proper</a>
          - A repository of reusable Java components.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="sandbox/index.html">The Commons Sandbox</a>
          - A workspace for Java component development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="dormant/index.html">The Commons Dormant</a>
          - A repository of components that are currently inactive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You may also read our <a href="charter.html">charter</a>,
        which spells out the goals of the project in greater detail.

    </section>

    <section name="The Commons Proper">
      <p>
        The Commons Proper is dedicated to one principal goal:
        creating and maintaining reusable Java components. The
        Commons Proper is a place for collaboration and sharing, where
        developers from throughout the Apache community can work
        together on projects to be shared by the Apache projects and
        Apache users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commons developers will make an effort to ensure that their
        components have minimal dependencies on other libraries, so that
        these components can be deployed easily. In addition, Commons
        components will keep their interfaces as stable as possible, so
        that Apache users (including other Apache projects) can implement
        these components without having to worry about changes in the
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        This <a href='http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/06/25/commons.html'>article</a>
        gives an overview of (some of) the components which can be found here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We welcome participation from all that are interested, at all
        skill levels. Coding, documentation and testing are all critical
        parts of the software development process. If you are interested
        in participating in any of these aspects, please join us!

    <section name="The Commons Sandbox">
      <p>
        This project also contains a workspace that is open to all
        Apache committers. It's a place to try out new ideas and prepare
        for inclusion into the Commons portion of the project or into
        another Apache project. Users are free to experiment with the
        components developed in the sandbox, but sandbox components will
        not necessarily be maintained, particularly in their current
        state.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>See <a href="http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/">here</a> for Sandbox components.</strong>
      </p>

    </section>
    <section name="The Commons Dormant">
      <p>
        These are Commons Sandbox components that have been deemed
        inactive since they have seen little recent development activity.
        If you wish to use any of these components, you must build them
        yourselves. It is best to assume that these components will not be
        released in the near future.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>See <a href="http://commons.apache.org/dormant/">here</a> for Dormant components.</strong>
      </p>

    </section>

    <section name="Where do I get releases?">
      <p>
        The individual components have independent releases. Some releases
        for some components may be available only through the mirroring system.
        Some releases for some components (typically the older ones) are not
        available through the mirroring system.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the individual websites listed above for the specific downloads, or use the
        <a href="downloads/index.html">Releases</a>
        menu option.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="How do I contribute, give feedback, fix bugs and so on?">
      <p>
        The Commons project really needs and appreciates any contributions,
        including documentation help, source code and feedback.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Discussion occurs on the

    <section name="Related Components @Apache">
      <p>
      The Commons HttpClient project used to be a part of Commons, but is now part of
      <a href="http://hc.apache.org/">Apache HttpComponents</a> - see 
      <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html">Jakarta Commons HttpClient</a>  
      </p>
      <p>
        Some other Apache Projects also have commons subprojects:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href='http://ws.apache.org/commons/'> <strong>commons@ws.apache.org</strong>
              - reusable library components for web service development.
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href='http://xml.apache.org/commons/'> <strong>commons@xml.apache.org</strong>
              - common packaging for standards code plus xml-related utilities.
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        So, if you can't find what you need here, you might like to take a look there.
        Some components which started out here have migrated to these other places.
