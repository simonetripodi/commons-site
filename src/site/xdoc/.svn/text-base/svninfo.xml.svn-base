<section name="Download the Source">

<p>
Most users of the source code probably don't need to have day to
day access to the source code as it changes. For these users we
provide easy-to-unpack source code downloads. See the "Releases"
link on the Commons page.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Access the Version Control System (quick info)">
<p>
Enter the following URL into a web browser to browse the latest source code,
or pass that same url to a subversion client application to check the code out
to your local machine, after replacing {component-name} with the appropriate
value.
<pre>
   http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/{component-name}/trunk
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, enter the following URL into a web browser to browse the latest
source code including history and commit information. Note that despite the
name "viewvc" appearing in this link, the information <i>is</i> from the
ASF Subversion repository.
<pre>
   http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/{component-name}/trunk
</pre>
</p>
</section>

<section name="Access the Version Control System (details)">
<p>
The root url of the ASF Subversion repository is <b>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/</b>
for read-only access and <b>https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/</b> for committers. 
</p>
<p>
The URLs for direct access to the commons section of that repository are:
<ul>
<li>
 <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons">
   http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons
 </a>
 for non-committers, and
</li>
<li>
 <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons">
   https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons
 </a>
 for committers.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The "proper" subdirectory leads to the code for official commons components.
The "sandbox" subdirectory leads to the code for experimental commons components.
</p>
<p>
Subdirectories "trunks-proper" and "trunks-sandbox" are special directories that
should be ignored by most users; they have Subversion "external attributes"
associated with them so that when checking out those directories using a subversion
client application, the directory created actually contains the "trunk" directory
of every commons or sandbox project. This is useful for special purposes such as
building the commons website. Most users can ignore these directories and access
the trunk of a project via the "proper" or "sandbox" directory.
</p>
<p>
You can directly browse the <i>latest</i> version of ASF the code in Subversion by entering
one of the above URLs into a standard web browser. Once you have found a directory of 
interest, you can pass the same URL to a subversion client in order to check
out the files locally.
</p>

<p>
As an alternative, you can browse the repository (including access to file history)
via one of the links below. Once you have found a file or directory of
interest, replace the url prefix "http://svn.apache.org/viewvc" with the
appropriate subversion root url (see above).
<ul>
<li><a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper">browse proper components via viewer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/sandbox">browse sandbox components via viewer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/dormant">browse dormant components via viewer</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Important!</b> When checking out a directory in subversion, ensure that you
do not check out a directory that has "tags" and "branches" subdirectories, as this will
result in getting a complete copy of the code for every branch and tag ever made.
If you want the latest code, you generally want the directory <b>{component-name}/trunk</b>,
though you should check the project directory structure first via one of the methods
listed above, as different projects may use different internal directory structures.
For example, some projects which support multiple versions of Java may use 
<b>{component-name}/branches/{branch-name}</b> as well as {component-name}/trunk.
</p>
<p>
<b>Important!</b> At the current time, selecting by date in subversion within the
ASF repository isn't reliable. The reason is that when converting a date to a revision
number, subversion assumes that revision N has an earlier date than revision N+M, and
that it can therefore perform a binary search on revision numbers to locate one with
the required date. However CVS imports of data that retain the original date
information from CVS break this assumption. And unfortunately because revisions
are repository-wide information, this affects date-based searches
even in directories unrelated to the ones that CVS stuff was imported into.
So while dates are reported correctly in "svn log" output, only revision numbers should
be used with the -r option. See issue #752 in the subversion issue tracker at tigris.org.

<p>
Subversion is an open-source version control system designed to be "a better CVS".
